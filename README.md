# Predictive Voyage: ML Models for Passenger Transportation Analysis

This repository contains code for a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether passengers were transported by an anomaly using records recovered from a damaged spaceship's computer system.

## Overview

The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict whether passengers were transported by an anomaly based on data recovered from the spaceship's computer system. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and consists of various features related to passenger information and anomaly indicators.

## Data Collection

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. It includes records recovered from the spaceship's computer system, containing information about passengers and anomaly indicators.

## Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

Prior to model training, the dataset underwent a comprehensive data cleaning process to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Feature engineering techniques were applied to extract relevant information and create new features that could potentially enhance model performance.

## Model Implementation

Various machine learning algorithms were implemented, including logistic regression, decision tree, bagging, random forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting. Each model was trained and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.

## Model Evaluation

After thorough evaluation, Gradient Boosting emerged as the most accurate model, achieving a performance of 74%. This model was selected for further analysis and deployment.
